# NeuralNetFromScratch
A neural network implemented from scratch (without using PyTorch or similar) to classify MNIST digits data

## Implementation Plan
[NN Architecture](https://github.com/peterantonarosjr/NeuralNetFromScratch/blob/9c8ded2db5939447c836c470e854ab4ca66c5462/NN_Architecture.pdf)


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand conceptually what is occuring in a Neural Network. Sometimes it is easy to start slamming together different Python Functions and arriving at a reasonable results. This project with 1 hidden layers provides a concrete grasp of how a forward propogating NN operates.

## For the future
I am aiming to create a more robust framework that will allow for the following...

* RBG Images (3 channels)
* Other layers besides ReLu and SoftMax

and eventually building my way up towards a from-scratch convolutional neural network with custom convolution operations.
